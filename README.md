NLP Classical Deep Learning Model (pytorch)

This is a project to record my NLP learning process and share it with novices for reference.I always think that the spirit of open source is a very good idea. Although my current technical level is not enough, I think maybe this project can give some help to newcomers who want to take the road of NLP.
